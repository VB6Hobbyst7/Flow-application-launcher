Flow is an application launcher I designed and produced with a small team some time back. It was sold under the slogan "the world's fastest application launcher". It uses a different approach to accessing shortcuts compared to competing applications such as Launchy and similar.

When activated, usual application launchers gives you a prompt where you can type the name of the shortcut you are after. Flow on the other hand displays an onscreen keyboard, with shortcuts visible on the keys. You then simply press the key on your keyboard, that corresponds to the shortcut you are after.

You can have an unlimited amount of onscreen keyboard layouts, each with their own shortcuts. So you can have one for "Applications", one for "Websites", one for "Personal projects" and so forth. You can easily link layouts, so you for example can have a layout called "Personal projects" and then a unique layout for each project, containing shortcuts to relevant files, folders, applications and websites.

Flow is open source and coded in VB.NET.

You can read more about it and download it for free at [https://flowlauncher.codeplex.com/ Codeplex].
