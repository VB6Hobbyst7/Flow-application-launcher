Flow is an application launcher me and my team developed back in 2009 or 10. It was initially for commercial purpose, but has since been open-sourced. It's built in Winforms, VB.NET and a bunch of WinAPI code.

This hasn't been updated for a while, so there might be inconsistencies, however most should be accurate.

**Requirements**

.NET framework 2.0

Telerik rad controls (you will need Radcontrols for Winforms to be able to modify the UI).

**Description**

Flow was sold under the slogan "the world's fastest application launcher". It uses a different approach to accessing shortcuts compared to competing applications such as Launchy and similar.

When activated, usual application launchers gives you a prompt where you can type the name of the shortcut you are after. Flow on the other hand displays an onscreen keyboard, with shortcuts visible on the keys. You then simply press the key on your keyboard, that corresponds to the shortcut you are after.

You can have an unlimited amount of onscreen keyboard layouts, each with their own shortcuts. So you can have one for "Applications", one for "Websites", one for "Personal projects" and so forth. You can easily link layouts, so you for example can have a layout called "Personal projects" and then a unique layout for each project, containing shortcuts to relevant files, folders, applications and websites.
